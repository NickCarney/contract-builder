          In the context of music intellectual property (IP), an administrator is
          responsible for managing the rights and revenues associated with a
          songwriter&apos;s or composer&apos;s music. This role typically involves
          overseeing various aspects of licensing, royalty collection, and
          ensuring proper copyright protection. Administrators often work with
          music publishers, but independent songwriters and artists can also hire
          them directly to handle the business side of their music. Here&apos;s a
          breakdown of what a music IP administrator typically does:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Copyright Registration: They ensure that the song or composition is
            properly registered with the relevant copyright offices and performing
            rights organizations (PROs) to protect the intellectual property.
          </li>
          <li>
            Licensing: Administrators negotiate and manage licenses for the use of
            the music. This can include synchronization licenses (for film, TV,
            and commercials), mechanical licenses (for physical or digital
            distribution), and public performance licenses (for radio, live
            performances, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Royalty Collection: They monitor and collect royalties from various
            sources, including streaming services, radio, live performances, and
            sales, both domestically and internationally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payments: Administrators distribute royalties to the songwriters,
            composers, and any other rights holders, ensuring that all parties
            receive their fair share.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rights Enforcement: They monitor the use of the music to make sure
            itâ€™s not being used without permission, and they may take legal action
            in cases of infringement or unauthorized use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reporting and Auditing: Administrators provide detailed reports on
            royalties and earnings and may also audit music users or platforms to
            ensure accurate payment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Overall, the administrator acts as a key business manager for the
          intellectual property of music, ensuring that the creators are
          compensated and their rights are protected.
