      "3": "What is Publishing?",
      "4": "Publishing refers to the rights management of your music. When you write or compose a song, you own the copyright to that piece of music. Copyright ensures that you are paid when your music is used commercially, such as when it is streamed, played on the radio, or used in TV or film.",
